DB Config:

Download and install XAMPP: (https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html)

Execute XAMPP and start both Apache and MySQL.

Go to Explorer (there is a button at the right in the XAMPP App) and 'apiTF' folder to /htdocs inside xamp files

then go to your browser and enter: (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)

Here you create a new DB and import the "usuarios.sql" file and it will create a new table named usuarios.
